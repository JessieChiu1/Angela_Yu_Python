## Introduction

This is a classic Pong game built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. It is a 2 players game where one player control the W and S key while the other control the arrow up and arrow down key.

## Future Improvements / Potential Features

It is a bit slow at the beginning and I can change the initial ball speed, but it works fine in general.
