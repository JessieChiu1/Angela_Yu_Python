## Introduction

This app will prompt the user for a date and it will web scrape the Billboard Top 100 songs with Beautiful Soup.

It will login to your spotify and create a new playlist with the date and adds all the songs from the Billboard Top 100.

## Challenges

It was a challenges reading documentation to figure out what to do and the OAuth login was not the clearest to me but I figure it out with chatGPT and some googling.
