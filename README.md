# 100 Days of Code - Python Projects and Exercises ðŸš€

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code repository! Here, you'll discover a collection of exercises and projects completed during my journey through the "100 Days of Code: Python" Udemy course by Angela Yu. This course has been an exciting and educational experience, and I'm thrilled to share my progress with you.

**Each project was crafted independently with minimal referencing of video walkthroughs, allowing me to explore and develop my coding skills. I used the final project goals as a reference point and built each project from scratch, often exceeding the original scope to challenge myself and create more robust solutions.**

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my learning journey as I worked through the course's Python exercises and projects. For each project, I not only completed the required tasks but often added my own creative touch, often incorporating additional features that I found valuable.

Feel free to explore the individual project folders to delve into the details, including code and documentation, of each project. It's a testament to my growth and development as a Python programmer during this exciting 100-day challenge.
