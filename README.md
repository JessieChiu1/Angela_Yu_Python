# 100 Days of Code - Exercises

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code repository! In this repository, you'll find the exercises and projects completed as part of the "100 Days of Code: Python" Udemy course by Angela Yu. The course has been a fantastic journey of learning and coding, and I'm excited to share my progress with you.

This repository serves as a record of my journey through the course, where I completed various Python projects and exercises. For each project, I look at the final project for the day and complete it with my own logic, often adding new features I think is important 

Feel free to explore each project folder for more details, including code and documentation.
