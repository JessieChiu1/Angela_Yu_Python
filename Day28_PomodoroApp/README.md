## Introduction

Welcome to the Pomodoro App! This app is designed to help you implement the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method inspired by the iconic tomato-shaped kitchen timer. The Pomodoro Technique breaks your work time into intervals, alternating between focused work and short breaks to boost productivity.

Key features of the app include:

- A visual representation of the Pomodoro timer with a tomato-shaped image.
- Real-time countdown display.
- Checkmarks to track completed work intervals.

## Main App Code (main.py)

The core functionality of the Pomodoro App is implemented in the `main.py` script. Here's an overview of its key components:

- **CONSTANTS**: Defined constants for colors, fonts, and time intervals.

- **Window and Canvas Setup**: Configuration of the main application window and canvas for displaying the timer.

- **Countdown Mechanism**: The app's timer logic, including countdown and transitioning between work and break intervals.

- **Button Event Listeners**: Event listeners for the "Start" and "Reset" buttons.

- **Widget Setup**: Configuration and placement of labels, buttons, and checkmarks.

## Future Improvements / Potential Features

While the app is fully functional, there are potential areas for future enhancements:

- **Customizable Time Intervals**: Allow users to set their preferred work and break durations.

- **Audio Notifications**: Implement audio alerts (dings) when a work or break interval ends to remind users to switch tasks.
