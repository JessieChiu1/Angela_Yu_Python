## Introduction

This app is built to emulate the Pomodoro Technique! It is a time management technique based on the tomato shape kitchen timer. This app will break down work/break interval and alternate between working and taking a break. 

## Future Improvements / Potential Features

I can add a feature that allows the user to determine the time interval.

I can add a feature where the timer will ding when time is up to remind user to switch up the task at hand.
