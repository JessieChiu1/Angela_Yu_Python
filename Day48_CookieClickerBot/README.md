## Introduction

This Python script automates the process of playing the popular online game [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). It utilizes the Selenium web automation library to perform actions like clicking the big cookie, buying upgrades, and purchasing items from the store, all to help you maximize your cookie production effortlessly.

## Required Libraries

To run this script, you'll need to install the following Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python.
2. The script will automate clicking the big cookie, buying upgrades, and purchasing items from the store.

## Gameplay Loop

The script continuously clicks the big cookie, buys upgrades, and purchases items from the store in an infinite loop to maximize cookie production.

## Potential Features

While the script currently provides basic automation for Cookie Clicker, you can consider adding the following feature:

1. **Save Game/Load Game**: Implement a feature that allows users to save their Cookie Clicker game progress and later load it. This feature would enable users to continue their gameplay from where they left off, even after closing the script or the browser.

Adding a "Save Game/Load Game" feature would enhance the usability and convenience of the script for Cookie Clicker players.
