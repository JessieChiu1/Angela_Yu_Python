## Introduction

This is a classic Snake game built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. It's a fun and nostalgic game where you control a snake to collect food and grow longer without running into the walls or yourself.

Built with object oriented programming principle. 

## Future Improvements / Potential Features

Tkinter's pixel system is not the best and there can be further refinement.
