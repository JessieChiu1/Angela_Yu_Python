## Introduction

Welcome to the Open Trivia API-based Quiz app! üéâ

This quiz app sources trivia questions from the [Open Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php), providing a fun and engaging way to test your knowledge. To make the experience even more interactive, I've added widgets that allow users to customize various parameters, such as category, difficulty, and question type.

### Required Libraries

Before running this app, make sure to install the following Python library:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Features

- Choose from a wide range of trivia categories.
- Select your preferred difficulty level.
- Pick between multiple-choice and true/false questions.
- Track your score as you progress through the quiz.
- Enjoy an extensive collection of thought-provoking questions.

## Challenges Overcome

During the development of this app, I encountered several challenges, including:

- Managing multiple listbox widgets and preventing them from interfering with each other.
- Dynamically fetching trivia questions from the Open Trivia API based on user selections.
- Making sure the button is not position awkwardly between T/F questions and MC questions.

## Future Improvements

Here are some potential features I plan to add in the future:

- Implementing a timer for each question to add an element of time pressure.
- Allowing users to save their quiz results and view their performance history.
- Providing explanations for correct answers to enhance the learning experience.
