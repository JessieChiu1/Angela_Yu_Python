## Introduction

This is a quiz app where the trivia questions are sourced from <a href="https://opentdb.com/api_config.php">Open Trivia API</a>. I expanded on the original scope of the project by creating widgets that allow user to select the various parameters. 


## Challenges

Since I added widgets that allow user to select the parameters of the API call, I added multiple listbox widgets. I had a lot of issue with teh listbox widgets because when you selected an option from one listbox, the other listbox option disappear. I did a lot of digging until I found an option to disable this feature.
