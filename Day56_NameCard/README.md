# Intro to Flask - Serving up Static and CSS File

## Introduction

This is a small project to learn how to not hardcode HTML in the Flask app and use `render_template` instead.
- **All** template must be in **template** folder
- **All** static file(image, css, etc) must be in the **static** folder 
    - Chrome will cache your static file, so if you add static file, just hold SHIFT and click the reload button on chrome

## Required Libraries

To run this script, you'll need to install the following Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install Flask
```
