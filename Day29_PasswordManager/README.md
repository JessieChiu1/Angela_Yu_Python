## Introduction

This app is built to manage and store your login/password for different website.

It can:
- retrieve login/password for sites
- generate unique password and copy it to clipboard
- add new login/password info for sites

## Challenges

When I switch from .txt file to .json for storing my passowrd info, I forgot to change the .gitignroe and accidentally push info to my GitHub. I had to learn how to remove those information in my commit history.
