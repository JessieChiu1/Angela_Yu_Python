## Introduction

Welcome to the Password Manager app! This application is designed to help you manage and securely store login/password information for different websites.

Key features of the app include:

- Retrieving login/password information for websites.
- Generating unique passwords and copying them to the clipboard.
- Adding new login/password information for websites.

## Challenges

During the development of this app, there were challenges, including:

- Transitioning from .txt file storage to .json format, which involved updating the .gitignore file to prevent accidental pushes of sensitive information to GitHub. This required learning how to remove the information from commit history.
