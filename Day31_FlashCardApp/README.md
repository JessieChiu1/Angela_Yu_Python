## Introduction

Welcome to the Chinese HSK Flash Card Study App! This application is designed to help you study and improve your Chinese HSK vocabulary. It utilizes the power of pandas to parse a CSV file containing a comprehensive list of words and their definitions.

Key features of the app include:

- Displaying a Chinese word for a brief moment, followed by the correct definition after 3 seconds.
- Allowing users to indicate their knowledge of a word by clicking either the checkmark or X button.
- Tracking and storing both correct and incorrect word lists to monitor your progress.

## Future Improvements / Potential Features

While the app is already a valuable tool for studying Chinese HSK vocabulary, there are potential enhancements and features for the future:

- **Spaced Repetition**: Implement a feature where words you know well are shown less frequently, while words you struggle with appear more often, optimizing your learning.
- **User Profiles**: Create user profiles to track progress and tailor word selection based on individual learning needs.
- **Audio Pronunciation**: Include audio pronunciation for each word to improve listening and speaking skills.
