## Introduction

This app is built to study for the Chinese HSK vocabulary. It used pandas to parse through an csv file with all the words and definitions.

The screen will display a word and after 3 seconds will display the correct definition for given word.

The user will click on either the check or X button to indicate whether they know the word or not. 

The app will store your correct and incorrect word list to track progress.

## Future Improvements / Potential Features

I can add a feature where the words will show up again but if you know the word, they shows less frequently while the words you got wrong will show up more frequently.
